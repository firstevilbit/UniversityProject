# Website for university.

This is my graduation project at the university. The theme of the diploma project is "Create an Information Site for the University." The site engine was written in PHP4 in 2007. I adapted the engine for PHP7, simply replacing some functions with analogues. For data storage the MySQL database is used. The engine is made in the form of modules with various functionalities.

- inc_config.php - Contains basic global site settings.
- Module "Menu" - Menu for navigating the site.
- Module "Address Bar" - Additional navigation for as an address bar at the top of the site.
- Module "News" - Publication of news, events.
- Module "Photo Gallery" - Photo gallery with filtering according to splits.
- Module "Manuals" - Section for downloading various files.
- There is also a part for site administration.

Support for OOP began only with php5, so the engine is written in the paradigm of procedural programming. The engine is far from ideal, actually laid out as is. Maybe someone will come in handy.
